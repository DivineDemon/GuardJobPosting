      <br />
      <p>
        We employ the latest encryption and security technology and fraud
        detection techniques in all areas of koala-base.com where you provide us
        with personal or account information. This is done to protect you from

        download and install the latest version of your favorite browser. For

        “cookies” — small files placed temporarily in your Internet browser — to
        keep track of your stay at our Web site. The text in a cookie, by
        itself, only tells us that you have visited our site before. When you
        place an order, request a catalog, or participate in a promotion or
        contest, we ask you to provide information including your name, postal
        address, e-mail address and, in the case of product orders, credit card

        we do not use or release any credit card, financial information or
        personal information for any purpose.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you provide us with your postal address, e-mail address or telephone
        number, you may receive our catalog or other promotional mailings,
        e-mails or telephone calls. If you receive an e-mail from us that you
        would rather not receive, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions set
        forth at the bottom of each e-mail. If you do not wish to receive our
        catalog, or other promotional, please write to us at
        support@koala-base.com. We will be happy to respect your request not to
        participate in our direct marketing programs.{" "}
